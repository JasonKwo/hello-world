# hello-world
Test repository for first time set-up

This is example text added to the readme.md file in a BRANCH of the master branch.

This should save a COMMIT with a commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.  Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contibutors can understand what you've done and why.

This diagram shows the master branch, a new feature branch, and the journey that feature takes before it's merged into master.
